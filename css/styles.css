Appointments
Create a website for booking appointments with you.

Users should be able to enter:
their name,
a description of the appointment,
the appointment date,
and start/end times.

After they submit the form:
they should receive a confirmation page telling them the booking was successful.
This page should also reprint the information they entered into your form.
